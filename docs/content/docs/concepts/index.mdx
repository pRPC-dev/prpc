# Concepts

Before diving into advanced usage, it helps to understand how pRPC thinks about RPC.

## What You'll Learn

- **Mental Model** — Procedures as typed functions, no OpenAPI middle layer
- **Protocol Design** — JSON-RPC over HTTP, simple and predictable
- **Error Handling** — Structured errors that flow from server to client

## Why This Matters

pRPC is designed around a simple idea: your API is a library of typed async functions. The protocol, adapters, and client exist to make that idea real — with minimal ceremony.
