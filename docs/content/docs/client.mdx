description: Calling your RPC procedures from Python and TypeScript.
---

pRPC provides two primary ways to consume your API: a native Python client and a generated TypeScript client.

## Python Client

The `RPCClient` is a powerful, type-safe client that supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls.

```python
from prpc import RPCClient

# Use as a context manager to ensure clean connection closing
with RPCClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    # Synchronous call
    result = client.add(a=5, b=10)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

### Async Calls
Use `.aio(...)` on any procedure to call it asynchronously.

```python
async with RPCClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    result = await client.add.aio(a=5, b=10)
```

## TypeScript Client

pRPC can generate a fully typed TypeScript client directly from your Python code.

### 1. Generate
Use the CLI to generate the client.

```bash
prpc codegen -m app.main -o src/api/client.ts
```

### 2. Usage
Import the generated client and call your procedures.

```typescript
import { Client } from './api/client';

const client = new Client('http://localhost:8000');

// Fully typed!
const result = await client.add(5, 10);
```

## Error Handling

pRPC uses structured errors. Errors in Python are raised as `RPCError`.

```python
from prpc import RPCError

try:
    client.divide(10, 0)
except RPCError as e:
    print(f"Error {e.code}: {e.message}")
```
