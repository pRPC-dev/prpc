# Context

Procedures receive only the JSON-RPC params. pRPC's core does not pass HTTP request context (headers, user, etc.) into procedures directly.

## Adapter-Specific Context

If you need request context, use your adapter's features:

**FastAPI** — Use `Depends` to inject request-scoped data. Your RPC endpoint is a FastAPI route, so you can depend on `Request`, auth, or custom dependencies. How this integrates with pRPC's handler depends on the adapter implementation.

**Flask** — Use `flask.g` or `flask.request` inside procedures. Ensure your procedure runs in a request context (it will when invoked via the Flask-mounted endpoint).

## Example (Flask)

```python
from flask import request, g
from prpc import rpc

@rpc
def get_current_ip() -> str:
    return request.remote_addr
```

When the procedure is called via the Flask RPC endpoint, `request` is in scope.

## Future Support

Planned improvements may add explicit context injection (e.g. a `Context` parameter) so procedures can access request data in an adapter-agnostic way.
