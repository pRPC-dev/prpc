# Server

This section covers everything you need to build a pRPC server.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Routers](/docs/server/routers)** — The procedure registry, `@rpc`, and organizing procedures
- **[Procedures](/docs/server/procedures)** — Defining procedures, types, sync vs async
- **[Context](/docs/server/context)** — Accessing request and adapter context
- **[Middleware](/docs/server/middleware)** — Framework middleware around your RPC endpoint
- **[Adapters](/docs/server/adapters)** — FastAPI, Flask, and ASGI integration

## Quick Reference

```python
from prpc import rpc
from prpc_fastapi import mount_fastapi

@rpc
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

mount_fastapi(app)
```

That's the core pattern: register with `@rpc`, mount with an adapter.
