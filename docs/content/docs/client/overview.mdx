# Client

This section shows how to call your pRPC server from different client environments.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Vanilla Python](/docs/client/vanilla)** — Use `RPCClient` in scripts, services, and CLIs.
- **[Next.js / TypeScript](/docs/client/nextjs)** — Use generated `PRPCClient` in React apps.
- **[Advanced](/docs/client/advanced)** — Error handling, testing, and customization.

## Quick Example (Python)

```python
from prpc import RPCClient

with RPCClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    result = client.add(a=10, b=5)
    print(result)  # 15
```

If your server exposes more procedures (via `@rpc`), they appear as dynamic methods on `client`.
